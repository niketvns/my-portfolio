                <p>The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have
                    originated in the 16th
                    century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to
                    'proper'
                    Latin. It contains a series of real Latin words.
                    In layman's terms, Lorem Ipsum is a dummy or placeholder text. It's often used in laying out print,
                    infographics, or web design. The primary purpose of Lorem Ipsum is to create text that does not
                    distract
                    from the overall layout and visual hierarchy.

                    Although the text is in Latin, it does not have any intelligible meaning. It's merely a generic text
                    used to hold a place in a file until the actual text or visuals are created to replace it.</p>
