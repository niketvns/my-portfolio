            <p>The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated in the 16th
                century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper'
                Latin. It contains a series of real Latin words.</p>

            <p>Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the visual impression of different
                typefaces Dummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the
                space which will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for example, the final text
                is not yet available. Dummy text is also known as 'fill text'.</p>

            <p>React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various
                components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the
                URL.
                Let us create a simple application to React to understand how the React Router works. The application
                will contain three components: home component, about a component, and contact component. We will use
                React Router to navigate between these components.</p>

            <p>Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to use state and other
                React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and
                lifecycle features from function components. It does not work inside classes.

                Hooks are backward-compatible, which means it does not contain any breaking changes. Also, it does not
                replace your knowledge of React concepts.</p>
